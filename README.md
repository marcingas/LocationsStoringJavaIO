# LocationsStoringJavaIO
program presents  Java IO functionality
I took Adventure Game and used try cathc for exceptions handling and then I took a list of directions and locations 
to make it more efficient and faster to read those directions and locations from .txt not from code in program. 
Now it has 140 locations to enter while playing this famaous game.
